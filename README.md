# 🛡 Malware Analysis Repository – Educational & Defensive Research

⚠️ **Educational Use Only – No Live Malware Hosted**

This repository contains structured cybersecurity analysis of **multiple types of malware**, including but not limited to:

- Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
- Spyware
- Keyloggers
- Info-stealers
- Ransomware (behavioral analysis)
- Persistence mechanisms
- Command & Control (C2) techniques
- Data exfiltration methods

All projects and write-ups in this repository are for **educational, defensive, and research purposes only**.

No operational malware, live payloads, or active command-and-control infrastructure will be provided here.

## 📌 Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Help cybersecurity students understand how different malware families operate
- Break down real-world attack techniques in a controlled way
- Teach detection and response strategies
- Provide Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Serve as a cybersecurity learning portfolio

Each malware type included will focus on:

- How it works
- What techniques it uses
- How it spreads (theoretically)
- How it maintains persistence
- How it steals or encrypts data
- How defenders detect it
- How to remove or mitigate it

## 🔍 What You Will Learn

By reviewing the analyses in this repository, you will understand:

- How modern malware establishes persistence
- Why legitimate services (like Discord) are abused for C2
- How credential theft works at a technical level
- How endpoint monitoring detects suspicious behavior
- How blue teams respond to compromise

## 🚩 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

Each malware breakdown will include:

- Network indicators
- Host-based artifacts
- Registry changes
- Suspicious command usage
- Detection recommendations

---

## 🛡 Defensive Focus

This repository prioritizes:

- Detection
- Prevention
- Incident response
- System hardening
- Security awareness

The goal is not to build malware — but to understand it well enough to defend against it.
